                 <h4>Policy on Return / Refund / Cancellation for <span>Online Shopping</span></h4>
                <p>Filsrich.com is a wholesale online shopping marketplace where manufacturers/producers sell directly to retailers/traders. Too many business deals originating from Filsrich involve large amounts, usually transacted offline through Banks directly by buyers and sellers. Filsrich, in such cases, acts merely as a platform or online meeting place and is not responsible for issues related to payment/shipment/returns/cancellations, etc. on such direct buyer-seller transactions. If you have to face any problem related to cancellations/returns/refund etc. are resolved by buyer and sellers through mutual negotiation. Such payments are never made through online payment gateways.</p>
<p>However, for small value transactions where the buyer is willing to pay through online payment gateway - filsrch.com offers a buyer protection program for wholesale online shopping. If a merchant wants to install an online payment gateway - it has to accept the following policy related to Refund / Return and Cancellation.

</p>
<h4>Return / Refund Policy for Products Paid through <span>Online Payment Gateways</span></h4>
<p>1. Buyer is fully protected through 7-day return guarantee for all products purchased from filsrich.com which are not as per ordered specifications, such as</p>
<p><span><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>    Defective</span></p>
<p><span><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>    Damaged</span></p>
<p><span><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>    Wrong Size</span></p>
<p><span><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>    Wrong Colour</span></p>
<p><span><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>    Wrong Quantity</span>
</p>
<h4>Accordingly different from the description given by the<span> merchant</span></h4>
<p>However, for some products, the sale is a final sale, and the merchant does not accept any return. Clothes products like undergarments, lingerie, swimsuits, etc. cannot be returned due to health & hygiene reasons.</p>
1. We'll also not be able to accept the return of the product</p>
<p><span><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>   Is used/worn or altered</span></p>
<p><span><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>   Show the physical damage to the box or the product</span></p>
<p><span><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>   Is returned without original packaging and accessories</span></p>
<p><span><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>   Serial Number has tampered</span></p>

<p>2. To request a return, please log-in to your account on filsrich.com and raise Return Request for concerned product. You will receive an email by filsrich.com after acknowledgment of your Request.</p>

<p>3. Any Items of clothes should be returned within seven days of receiving the product. If the buyer does not request a return/refund within seven days of receipt of the product, it will be assumed that the buyer is satisfied with the product.</p>

<p>4. Filsrich.com will review the returned Request. If necessary, a request is shared with the concerned merchant for approval.</p>

<p>5. After approval, the buyer will be required to send the product back through a reputed courier cost for shipping the product will be borne by the buyer.</p>

<p>6. Be certain the product hasn't been used/worn or even altered/tampered together with and is followed closely with its own original price label and packaging slip. On the box, then please say your sequence number.</p>

<p>7. After receiving the product, it will be verified against your claim. Replacement or refund is initiated after that. Replacement would depend on the stock availability.</p>

<p>8. It'll take some time taken between 1 to 3 weeks from the time a petition has been increased into the period the product is delivered back to us. Specific time would be based on the nature of the solution as well as where you are. Please rest assured that individuals work very hard to ensure your interests are protected.</p>

<p>9. We initiate the replacement or refund within two working days of receiving the product. For returns, it takes up to two weeks for the amount to get credited in your account after we have initiated the refund. The refund/replacement can get postponed or declined if the product we received is not in accordance with your claim, or you have not written the order number on the package.
</p>
<h4>Cancellation Policy for Products Paid through<span> Online Payment Gateways</span></h4>
<p>1. There may arise by situations where an order has to be cancelled. For example, a request may have to be cancelled when</p>
<p><span><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Product no long time available or temporarily out of stock</span></p>
<p><span><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Risk identified by credit and fraud avoidance department</span></p>
<p><span><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Inaccurate or insufficient address</span></p>
<p><span><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Non-serviceable locations</p>
<p>Sometimes we could also need additional verification or information before accepting any order. We'll call you if all or some part of your order is cancelled or if additional information must get your purchase. In case your purchase is cancelled after your payment has been created, the billed amount will be reimbursed to you when you can possibly.</p>
  
<p>2. The buyer can cancel an order by informing us well in advance before processing. In case we receive a cancellation message from your side within 24-Hrs of placing the order, and we have not processed the order, we will be more than happy to cancel the order and refund your entire amount. We wonâ€™t be able to cancel those Requests which have been processed and sent us out.
